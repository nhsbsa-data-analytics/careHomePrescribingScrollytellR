#### Primary care prescribing patterns for older care home patients in England ####

In this article we provide unique insight into primary care prescribing patterns for older care home residents in England during 2020/21.

We estimate that there were a monthly average of **284 thousand care home patients**, aged 65+ years receiving prescriptions each month in 2020/21. They received an estimated 34 million prescription items at a cost of **£318 million.** 

This accounts for around **X%** of patients aged 65+ years receiving prescription items and **£yy** of the total primary care drug spend for the 65+ population during 2020/21. 

Prescribing estimates are based on a sophisticated methodology which matches primary care prescription address data to care home addresses in <a href="https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-government/products/addressbase" target="_blank">AddressBase</a>, to create a prescribing dataset. The matching method has been available as a <a href="https://github.com/nhsbsa-data-analytics/addressMatchR" target="_blank">package</a>

These estimates address a key gap in knowledge and give valuable insights to inform the use and management of medicines in care homes to help improve health outcomes, the quality of care and ensure value.
